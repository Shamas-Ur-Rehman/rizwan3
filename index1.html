                JavaScript is the most popular and widely used client-side scripting language.
                 Client-side scripting refers to scripts that run within your web browser. 
                 JavaScript is designed to add interactivity and dynamic effects to the web pages
                  by manipulating the content returned from a web server.

                JavaScript was originally developed as LiveScript by Netscape in the mid 1990s.
                It was later renamed to JavaScript in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
                 Now JavaScript is the standard client-side scripting language for web-based applications,
                 and it is supported by 
                virtually all web browsers available today, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, etc.

                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a standard style sheet language used
                 for describing the presentation (i.e. the layout and formatting) of the web pages.

                Prior to CSS, nearly all of the presentational attributes of HTML 
                documents were contained within the HTML markup (specifically inside the HTML tags); 
                all the font colors, background styles, element alignments, 
                borders and sizes had to be explicitly described within the HTML.
                As a result, development of the large websites became a long and expensive process,
                 since the style information were repeatedly added to every single page of the website.

                In this article we will explore some of the unique and quite useful html tags which are ignored 
                or less common among web designers or developers. However, they 
                put in extra effort to achieve the same results even though they already have useful elements available.
